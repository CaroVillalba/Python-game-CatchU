## 🍓 Game Description – CatchU!

**CatchU!** is a rhythm-based game developed in **Python** and inspired by the game mode **osu!catch** from the osu! series.

### 🎮 Gameplay

In this game, you control a character holding a plate or basket at the bottom of the screen. Fruits fall from the top in sync with the rhythm, and your goal is to catch them all!

You must move left and right to catch the falling objects. Catching the wrong items will reduce your score or health.

This project recreates the core mechanics of osu!catch using Pygame and is ideal for practicing:

- Sprite handling and animation
- Real-time keyboard input
- Collision detection
- Game loop structure
- Score and health management

### 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pygame 🎮


While developing **CatchU!**, I strengthened my understanding of key programming concepts in **Python**, especially:
- ✅ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** I learned how to design and organize my game using **classes**, which allowed me to separate responsibilities like the player, fruit objects, game logic, and screen rendering.
- 🧱 **Code modularization:** Structuring the game in reusable and organized pieces improved the readability and maintainability of the project.
